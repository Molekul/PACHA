The PACHA project aims at providing a child-useable interface for basic
emergency admin actions. It has to be "useable by whoever has to, including
cooks" by design. The name stands for "Python Admintool for Cooks as Half
Admins" by the way.

It is designed to be easily extensible, and logs actions on the server. No
unwanted connection is assumed possible hence a very basic rights management
(ie "yes you can").

First steps : client, ssh and SNMP connexions.

Initial conception tried pyssh, but it seems that pexpect is much better at doing the job.
